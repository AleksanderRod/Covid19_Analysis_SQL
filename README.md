## Project Summary: COVID-19 Data Analysis

This project involves analyzing COVID-19 data using two primary datasets: **covidDeaths** and **covidVaccinations**. The SQL queries in this project are designed to extract meaningful insights related to COVID-19 cases, deaths, and vaccinations globally.

### Key Analyses:

1. **Death and Case Trends**:
   - The `covidDeaths` dataset is used to retrieve information on total deaths, new cases, and population across various locations. This data is ordered by location and date to understand trends over time.
   
2. **Death Percentage**:
   - A specific analysis calculates the percentage of deaths relative to the total number of cases, providing insights into the mortality rate for COVID-19 across different countries.
   
3. **Infection Rate**:
   - Another analysis computes the percentage of the population infected with COVID-19 by comparing new cases against the population for each location.

4. **High Infection Rates**:
   - The project also looks into countries with the highest infection rates in comparison to their population, helping to identify regions most affected by the pandemic.

This project is designed to offer insights into the progression of the pandemic by leveraging both the deaths and vaccination data, enabling users to understand global trends and impacts at different stages of the pandemic.
